# Getting Started

#What is the purpose of the Presentation.Core?

Presentation.Core has been designed primarily for non-visual code which is used to support
visual code. Whilst the library is not aimed at a particular UI technology, it's based upon 
the requirements for implementing WPF/UWP type applications.

#Why use Presentation.Core?

The aim is to supply tested, reusable code which minimizes the code required to implement user 
interfaces and to reduce the "cluttering" on the developer's code with often used/required 
functionality.
